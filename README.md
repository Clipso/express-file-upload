# Simple Node.js Express.js Application with express-fileupload

This is a basic Node.js and Express.js application that demonstrates how to handle file uploads using the `express-fileupload` middleware. With this middleware, you can easily handle file uploads in your Express.js application.

# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

# Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/express-fileupload-demo.git
   cd express-fileupload-demo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   The application will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

# Uploading Files

1. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

2. You will see a simple HTML form for file uploads.

3. Choose a file by clicking the "Choose File" button and then click the "Upload" button.

4. The server will process the file and store it in the `uploads/` directory.

# Configuration

You can configure the application by modifying the `config.js` file. This file contains various settings, including the upload directory and allowed file types.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  uploadDir: './uploads',   // The directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  allowedTypes: ['image/png', 'image/jpeg', 'image/jpg'], // Allowed file types.
};
```
